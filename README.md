# Zestimates-and-Public-Transit-in-LA-County

Despite long being known for its car-oriented culture and a suburban model of metropolitan area development, Los Angeles is moving towards expanding its mass transit system. Despite its benefits, rich, anti-development people rally against public transportation because of its perceived negative association with housing values. This paper determines whether public transportation positively impacts housing values using monthly ZIP Code-level Zillow estimates data from January 2000 to February 2022. Utilizing five Ordinary Least Squares models with a variety of controls and interactive variables, this paper concludes that single family benefit from public transportation more than condominiums homes, homes with more bedrooms are more likely to benefit from public transportation, and fears of public transit causing negative impacts on housing values are not based on any empirical evidence.
