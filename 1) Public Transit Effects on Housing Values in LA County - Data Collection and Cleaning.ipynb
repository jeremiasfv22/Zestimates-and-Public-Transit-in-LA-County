    "Los Angeles is a city/region known for its urban sprawl and car-oriented development. Despite this, Los Angeles is investing billions of dollars into its public transportation system to address the traffic congestion prevalent for its large population. An improved transportation system would bring the region to what is known as the Third Los Angeles: a new civic identity marked by more pedestrian-friendly and denser neighborhoods. This new era succeeds both the Second Los Angeles (the post-World War II era marked by the rise of the automobile, the freeway, and the single-family home) and the First Los Angeles (the pre-World War II era which laid the foundations for the city and included a vast network for public transportation destroyed, however, during the Second Los Angeles). However, the movement towards the Third Los Angeles faces resistance, predominantly from NIMBYs (an acronym for Not In My Back Yard, often used to refer to people who are anti-development). Major talking points for NIMBYs, upper-class NIMBYs in particular, about increased mass transit includes that it brings more unwanted people, particularly lower-income people, to their neighborhood, negatively impacts their homes' property values and shifts the character of their neighborhoods. However, public transportation could increase the values of surrounding land, therefore increasing the homes values surrounding it. \n",
